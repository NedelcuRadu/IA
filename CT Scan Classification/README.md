# Task
Participants have to train a model for CT scan classification. This is a multi-way classification task in which an image must be classified into one of the three classes (native, arterial, venous).

The training data is composed of 15,000 image files. The validation set is composed of 4,500 image files. The test is composed of 3,900 image file.

## Approach 

### 1. Trying various scikit learn models

### 2. Keras Transfer Learning with VGC16 and ResNet152V2

### 3. Training a NASNetLarge from scratch
